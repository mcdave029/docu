<!--
  As you can see here we called the @document where in we declared
  as new object in new action in documents_controller
  form_for will detect this as a create because the object is not
  yet existed and in initialization process
  you customize the path for this for some action you can specify
  url, controller and actions or the path just search on how to do
  it google wil give you hint on this for now this is a basic implementation
-->
<%= form_for @document do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :name, placeholder: "Document name" %>

  <%= f.fields_for :sections do |s| %>
    <%= render partial: "form_sections", locals: { s: s }%>
  <% end %>

  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
